# Project Name
Fullstack To-Do List

## Description

Duration: 6 hours

Made a fully functioning full stack to-do list web application that will receive the inputs for the tasks name and description and append it to the DOM as well as store it in a SQL database. The user is then given the option of either completing the task or deleting it. Clicking the complete button and completing the task will turn that task green as well removing the 'complete' button and replacing it with a completion message, therefor changing the boolean in the database from the default FALSE to TRUE. Deleting the task will remove the task from both database and DOM.
